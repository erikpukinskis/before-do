// Found this somewhere: I'm not saying "don't leave." I get that we all need time to go through things. I guess all I'm asking is that if you feel like you need help, just come out and ask for it. Literally say "I need your help. I need you to..." I'm also asking you to please be careful in asking for space and time; there are ways you can do it that don't hurt the person you're asking. Something like "I am struggling with some things right now and could use a little down time. Can we check back in...?"... those things are easier to hear than some of the things you have said in the recent past. Don't wait until it's the darkest point to ask for time or for help. Try and ask a little earlier.
